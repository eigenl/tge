All you need is your keyboard and a beverage of choice and you'll be up and running and creating awesome games in no time.

But let's be serious for a moment. TGE is a little text game engine using LUA. No need to build the engine if that's not your thing, just use the pre-built binary, plug in your scripts and you're set!

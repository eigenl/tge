Intro

Have you ever wanted to make a fun little game? Do you lack what it takes to draw killer graphics? Do you like letters? Have an irrational fear of large codebases? If any or none of these apply TGE is perfect for you! Just look:

All you need is your keyboard and a beverage of choice and you'll be up and running and creating awesome games in no time.

But let's be serious for a moment. TGE is a little text game engine using LUA. No need to build the engine if that's not your thing, just use the pre-built binary, plug in your scripts and you're set! I've included a few little examples to help you get going.

The engine was initially written for Text-Based Multiplayer Shooter (http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=240955605) but I thought it might be useful for others as well.

There are two text modes available: 80x25 and 40x25 characters.
